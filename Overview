Connect 4 - Project for AP Computer Science A June 2019
For my final project, I was tasked with making a game using Java. I decided to recreate Connect4 because I would play it 
over iMessage with friends. The UI component draws up the grid and replaces a space with an "X" or an "O" and print it out
to the console. The Engine component scanned for four of the same symbol in a row horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
The Engine is also responsible for alternating players. The game class keeps the game going by checking for winners every
round and prints out the winner of the game. The base class establishes the number of rows and columns as well as prompts
the user if they would like to use debug mode, which prints out the name of every method being used each turn.
