Connect 4 - Project for AP Computer Science A June 2019

For my final project, I was tasked with making a game using Java. I decided to recreate Connect 4 because I would often play 
it over iMessage with friends. There are four distinct parts of the program that are all intertwined for better resource 
management. The UI component draws up the grid and replaces a space with an "X" or an "O" wherever the player wants it. Then 
it prints out the updated board to the console. The Engine component scanned for four of the same symbol in a row 
horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The Engine is also responsible for alternating players. The Game class keeps the 
game going by checking for winners every round and printing out the winner of the game. The Base class establishes the number 
of rows and columns that are valid, and prompts the user if they would like to use debug mode, which prints out the name of 
every method being used each turn. By doing this, I was better able to fix my errors as it allowed me to find the root of 
the problem. I also allowed a player to redo their turn if they input an invalid column number. After demoing the game to a 
few friends, I presented it in front of the class and let students play it.
